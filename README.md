## üìãInstallation guide 

The project is structured such that the frontend and backend parts are organized into their respective folders. 

1. Clone the repository on your local machine using `git clone`(Place the project in the htdocs folder).
2. Navigate to the "frontend" directory.
3. Install project dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the application with `npm start`. The application should now be running on `localhost:3000`.
5. Download the Node.js installer from [officialwebsite](https://nodejs.org/en) and choose the version that suits your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
6. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Accept the license terms and choose the installation location. You can also customize the components to be installed, such as npm, the Node.js package manager.
7. Once the installation is complete, verify that Node.js and npm have been installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the commands node -v and npm -v. You should see the versions of Node.js and npm you have installed.
9. Navigate to the "backend" directory.
10. Run `composer install`.
11. Create a database named "namaste" in phpMyAdmin.
12. Then copy the Configuration File with the following command `cp .env.example . env.` Configure your file . env with details of your environment, such as the connection to the database.
13. Then you must generate the Application Key with the following command `php artisan key:generate`.
14. Then run Migrations and Seeds with the following command `php artisan migrate --seed`. This will configure the database structure, create the necessary tables and populate them with the test data that was preset in the project.
15. Start Development Server: Run the following command `php artisan serve`. The application will be available in http://localhost:8000 (or on the port specified by the console).
16. In another terminal you must Compile Assets with the command `npm run dev`. This command will compile the assets and place them in the appropriate folder for use in the application.
17. Access to the App: Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8000. You should see your application running.
18. Access your project in the browser: Open your web browser and visit the project path with localhost first.
19. Enjoy it.
